                <p class="fs-5 text-secondary">In late 2019, our family cat Atticus was diagnosed with Feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD). He had the symptoms of trouble urinating and had been seen squatting in his litterbox longer than usual.</p>
                <p class="fs-5 text-secondary">Medications were issued to Atticus and we were advised to monitor his bathroom behavior to see if his straining to urinate would alleviate. It was at that time when the idea of making an automatic cat bathroom Monitoring System came into being.</p>
                <p class="fs-5 text-secondary">The bathroom monitoring system can be used not only for when a cat is diagnosed with FLUTD, but also for preventative health monitoring.</p>

                <p class="fs-5 text-secondary">I (Jing Li) was a second language teacher with a master's degree in Education. I have lived in China, Canada, and now US. Experiencing different cultures, peoples, and ways of thinking has shaped me into an open-minded person who is always seeking for self-improvement by learning new skills to achieve my full potential.</p>
                <p class="fs-5 text-secondary">In this chapter of my life, I am exploring the world of computer science by teaching myself software developing skills to solve a real life problem - monitoring our family cat Atticus bathroom behavior in a fully automatic system for future FLUTD detection.</p>
                <p class="fs-5 text-secondary">I believe that with the right mindset and diligence to execute plans, all is possible. So here, I proudly present my first attempt of the automatic cat bathroom monitoring system.</p>
