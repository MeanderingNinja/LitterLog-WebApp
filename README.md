# The Cat Bathroom Monitoring System Web App

## Introduction
This web app is part of [the Cat Bathroom Monitoring System Project](https://github.com/emma-jinger/Cat_Bathroom_Monitoring_System) I've been working on. It displays the timestamps data corresponding to instances of a cat using the litterbox in the form of graphs and numbers. Specifically, on the web app, you can find:

- the profile of our family cat - Atticus
- the average number of bathroom visits on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis
- the average time Atticus spent per bathroom visit 
- the graph that shows the number of bathroom visits on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis
- the graph that shows the average time Atticus spent per bathroom visit on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis
- an About page that tells the story of the project and the author
