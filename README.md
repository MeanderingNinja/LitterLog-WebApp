# The Cat Bathroom Monitoring System Web App

## Introduction
This web app is part of [the Cat Bathroom Monitoring System Project](https://github.com/emma-jinger/Cat_Bathroom_Monitoring_System) I've been working on. It displays the timestamps data corresponding to instances of a cat using the litterbox in the form of graphs and numbers. Specifically, on the web app, you can find:

- the profile of our family cat - Atticus
- the average number of bathroom visits on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis
- the average time Atticus spent per bathroom visit 
- the graph that shows the number of bathroom visits on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis
- the graph that shows the average time Atticus spent per bathroom visit on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis
- an About page that tells the story of the project and the author

## Installation (for other developers?)
Provide instructions on how to install and run your web app. This could include:
### Clone the Repo
To download the code, navigate to a folder of your choosing on the your machine. First, make sure git is installed:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```
Then clone the `cat_bathroom_monitoring_system_web_app` project:
```
git clone https://github.com/emma-jinger/cat_bathroom_monitoring_system_web_app
cd cat_bathroom_monitoring_system_web_app
```

### Install dependencies:
Note for me on a brandnew machine: Before the following command, I need to make sure nodejs and nom are installed? Do I need to run in a virtual env? What does that mean? 
```
npm install
``` 
Note for me on my server: 

### Run the web server
```
npm start
```
Now you should be able to see the web app with this address `http://locahost:5001` on your browser.
